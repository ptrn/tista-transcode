### Index ###

Near the top of the page is an input field where the user can select and upload new videos. When the video is finished uploading the user is redirected to the site where the video will be available.

Further down is a list of already uploaded videos. Videos with annotations attached to it has an image of a text bubble in front of it.

### Video view ###

The subpage for viewing videos consists of the following parts:
  * the video
  * title
  * author
  * description
  * annotations
  * input field for uploading a series of annotations in SRT format

The format of the file containing the annotations must be as the SRT syntax is defined.

An example:

```
1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Altocumulus clouds occur between six thousand
 
2 
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800 
and twenty thousand feet above ground level.
```
